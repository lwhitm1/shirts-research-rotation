NOTE 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  With PME there is a minor soft core effect present at the cut-off,
  proportional to (LJsigma/rcoulomb)^6. This could have a minor effect on
  energy conservation, but usually other effects dominate. With a common
  sigma value of 0.34 nm the fraction of the particle-particle potential at
  the cut-off at lambda=0.5 is around 7.3e-05, while ewald-rtol is 1.0e-05.

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.135 nm, buffer size 0.035 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.100 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
