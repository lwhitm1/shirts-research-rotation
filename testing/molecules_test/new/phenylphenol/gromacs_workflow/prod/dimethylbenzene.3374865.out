  With PME there is a minor soft core effect present at the cut-off,
  proportional to (LJsigma/rcoulomb)^6. This could have a minor effect on
  energy conservation, but usually other effects dominate. With a common
  sigma value of 0.34 nm the fraction of the particle-particle potential at

The largest distance between non-perturbed excluded atoms is 0.153 nm

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K

Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.135 nm, buffer size 0.035 nm

Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.100 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm

Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 28x28x28, spacing 0.125 0.125 0.125

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.34

This run will generate roughly 13 Mb of data
